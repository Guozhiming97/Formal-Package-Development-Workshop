This guide is intended as a means of quickly getting started with the package **simTools**. It will introduce the main workflow of the package. 

## Getting Started

The main function in the **simTools** package is `sampleFromData`. This function will allow you to generate random samples from a given data set. It is useful for simulation experiments. 

### Loading the package

Before starting you will need to load the package in the usual way using either `library` or `require`. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(simTools)
```

### Running the main function

Once the package is loaded we can run the function as follows:

```{r}
example1 <- sampleFromData(airquality, size = 5)
example1
```
